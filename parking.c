/*
    EV Charging Simulator

    This program simulates a number of cars N attempting to charge on a number of chargers M, where N < M.

    Each car needs Y minutes of charging time.

    Each car can make reservations on up to M chargers. As time passes and chargers become free, reservations are fulfilled.

    Once a car is charging on any charger, its reservations on any other chargers are canceled. Once a car has finished charging,
    the charger is freed and the car is marked as charged.

    The simulation ends when all cars have been charged.

    TODO:
    - [ ] add formatter, linter, valgrind, and so on.
    - [ ] reorg this file for readability.
    - [ ] improve simulation by making reservations once clock has begun, simulating people arriving later in the day to reserve.
    - [ ] randomize which chargers we pick. current implementation loads up the first few chargers and leaves the last ones idle.
